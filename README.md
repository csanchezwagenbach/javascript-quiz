# javascript-quiz

## Description
With an ability to write basic applications using JavaScript, taking full advantage of the Web API was a natural next step. This quiz utilizes JavaScript and the Web API to test users' understandings of the rudimentary basics of JavaScript. Users can save their high scores so that they are able to track their progress against their peers as they progress through their learning. Users no longer must idly wonder if their skills match up, now they may put them to the test.

When the timer reaches 0 or the user runs out of questions, the user is brought to the end game display. Here the users will see their final score reported back to them and be given the opportunity to contribute their initials and high score to the running list.
